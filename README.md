## 🗣️ About

> _This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed you’ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting._

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/appinha/42cursus/tree/master/_PDFs).

	🚀 TLDR: this project consists of coding a program that finds the lowest possible number of moves to
	sort a random list of integers using 2 stacks and a limited set of operations

## 📑 Index

`@root`

* [**📁 includes:**](includes/) contains the program's headers.
* [**📁 libft:**](libft/) contains the source code of the `libft` library, which is used in the program.
* [**📁 srcs:**](srcs/) contains the source code of the program.
* [**Makefile**](Makefile) - contains instructions for compiling the program and testing it.

_Note: program covers only mandatory requirements of the project's subject._

## 🛠️ Usage

### Requirements

The program is written in C language for **Linux** distributions and thus needs the **`clang` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the program**

To compile the program, run:

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Executing the program**

To execute the program, run:

```shell
$ ./push_swap $ARG
```

where `$ARG` is a space separated list of integers, e.g. `ARG="1 5 2 4 3"`
